These lines of code are using the TypeToken class from the Gson library to create a Type object that represents the generic type of a list of mailboxes. The TypeToken class is a way to capture the actual type parameters of a generic type, which are normally erased at runtime due to type erasure. By creating an anonymous subclass of TypeToken and passing the generic type as a type parameter, you can preserve the type information and get a Type object that reflects the generic type.

The getType method returns the Type object that was created by the TypeToken class. This Type object can then be used as the second parameter of the fromJson method, which converts a JSON string into a Java object of the specified type. By passing the Type object that represents the list of mailboxes, you are telling the fromJson method to parse the JSON string into a List<MailBox> object.

public List<MailBox> readAllMailBoxes() {
        List<MailBox> mailBoxes = new ArrayList<>();

        try {
            File file = new File(fileName);

            if (!file.exists()) {
                // Create the file if it doesn't exist
                file.createNewFile();
            }

            try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) {
                String line;
                Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().create();
                while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                    // parse the line into a list of mailboxes
                    Type listType = new TypeToken<List<MailBox>>() {}.getType();
                    mailBoxes = gson.fromJson(line, listType);
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception in UserHandler reading mailboxes " + e);
        }

        return mailBoxes;
    }
